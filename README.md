# Deep-learning-oneshot
ðŸ¤– Deep_Learning_OneShot is a project focused on implementing and experimenting with one-shot learning using deep learning techniques. One-shot learning aims to enable models to recognize new classes or objects from just a single example, which is a significant leap towards human-like learning.
